## 🚀 Introduction

Welcome to **Algorithm Visualizer** – a web application designed to showcase various algorithms and data structures, providing a dynamic and visually engaging experience. This project is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## 🎨 Features

- **Interactive Visualizations:** Explore and understand different algorithms through interactive visual representations.
- **Modern UI/UX:** Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS for a sleek and responsive design.
- **Educational Tool:** Perfect for students and educators to learn and teach algorithms.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Deployment:** [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

## 📚 Available Algorithms

### Sorting Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort:** A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Merge Sort:** An efficient, stable, comparison-based, divide and conquer sorting algorithm.
- **Quick Sort:** An efficient, in-place sorting algorithm that in practice is faster than MergeSort and HeapSort.

### Searching Algorithms
- **Binary Search:** A fast search algorithm that works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
- **Linear Search:** A basic search algorithm that checks every element in the list until the desired element is found.

### Graph Algorithms
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** An algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph.
- **A* Search:** A graph traversal and path search algorithm that is often used in many fields of computer science due to its performance and accuracy.

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
